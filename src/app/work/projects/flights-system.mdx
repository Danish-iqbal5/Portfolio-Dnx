# Flight Management System

Developed a secure backend for flight management with JWT authentication, passenger data handling, and role-based access control using Node.js and Express.

## Key Features

- Secure JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin, Staff, Passenger)
- Flight scheduling and booking management
- Passenger data handling with encryption
- Automated email notifications
- API rate limiting and security measures

## Technical Implementation

- **Backend Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
- **Security**: Input validation, sanitization, and encryption
- **Testing**: Jest with supertest for API testing
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger docs

## Security Measures

- Implemented robust input validation
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration for API security
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Regular security audits and updates

## Learning Outcomes

This project enhanced my understanding of:
- Building secure REST APIs
- Implementing complex authentication flows
- Database design for scalable systems
- API documentation best practices
- Security considerations in backend development
